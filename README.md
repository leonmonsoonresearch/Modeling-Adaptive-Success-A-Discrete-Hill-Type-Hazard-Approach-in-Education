Learner’s Tau Distribution — Simulation & Visualization Toolkit

Author: Leon Monsoon
Version: 3.0

This repository contains the complete Python implementation for the Learner’s Tau Distribution, a novel discrete probability model for adaptive success over time. The included tau.py script generates all figures used in the research paper:

“Learner’s Tau: A Novel Discrete Probability Distribution for Adaptive Success Over Time.”

The script also includes parameter recovery experiments, bootstrap visualizations, log-likelihood surfaces, and all computational components defining the distribution.
